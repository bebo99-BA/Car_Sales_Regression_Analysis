# 🚗 Car Resale Price Prediction & Market Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview

**Car Sales Intelligence** is an end-to-end data science project that combines **exploratory market analysis**, **statistical modeling**, and **machine learning–based price prediction** into a single interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The project is designed to simulate a **real-world resale pricing system**, exposing both **market-level insights** and **instance-level predictions**, while maintaining statistical rigor and interpretability.

**Primary goals:**

* Analyze resale market behavior across brands, fuel types, and years
* Address skewed price distributions using statistical transformations
* Train a robust ML regression model for resale price estimation
* Deliver insights and predictions through an interactive dashboard

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand:

* Price distribution skewness and outliers
* Brand-level resale dominance
* Fuel-type market composition
* Temporal price trends

Key findings:

* Resale prices exhibit strong right skew
* Brand contribution is highly imbalanced
* Fuel type significantly impacts resale value
* Older vehicles show non-linear depreciation patterns

## Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

This stage focuses on transforming raw attributes into **model-ready features**.

Key steps:

* Removal of duplicates and invalid price entries
* Separation of numerical and categorical features
* Numerical feature scaling
* Categorical feature encoding
* Preservation of feature consistency for inference

---

## Target Variable Transformation

Resale prices violate normality assumptions required for stable regression learning.

To address this:

* **Box-Cox transformation** was applied to the target variable
* Transformation stabilizes variance and improves model generalization
* Inverse transformation is applied during prediction to return prices in USD

<img width="1784" height="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee6cfc7-73c1-426a-8d3f-1f75ee9308fa" />


---

## Model Selection

### Chosen Model: Random Forest Regressor

**Rationale:**

* Captures non-linear relationships
* Robust to outliers
* Strong performance on tabular, mixed-feature datasets
* Minimal feature scaling sensitivity

Alternative models were considered but deprioritized due to interpretability or robustness constraints.

---

## Model Training & Evaluation

**Training Strategy:**

* Train–test split
* Fixed random state for reproducibility

**Evaluation Metric:**

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Performance Interpretation:**

* MAE represents expected deviation from true resale price
* Used directly to construct prediction confidence ranges in the dashboard


| Model                |	R2     | MSE    |
| ElasticNet ML Linear |	0.6724 | 0.0014 |
| Random Forest	       |  0.8244 | 0.0007 |

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

* Box-Cox transformation chosen over log due to flexibility
* Random Forest selected for robustness over linear interpretability
* MAE preferred over RMSE for real-world pricing clarity

---

## Limitations

* No regional price segmentation
* No temporal retraining pipeline
* Dataset assumes consistent market conditions
